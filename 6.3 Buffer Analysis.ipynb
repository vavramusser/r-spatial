    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a buffer analysis to assess population exposure to air pollutants using PM2.5 data from the [U.S. EPA Air Quality System (AQS)](https://www.epa.gov/aqs). [Buffer analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_analysis) is essential in spatial data analysis for identifying areas impacted within a specified distance of a point location, such as air quality monitoring sites. Here, we will create buffers around PM2.5 monitoring sites and overlay population data to estimate the population potentially exposed to pollutants within these buffer zones."

    "\n",
    "The [EPA’s Air Quality System (AQS) API](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html) provides access to detailed, historical data on ambient air quality collected across the United States. Developed and maintained by the [United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov), the [Air Quality System (AQS)](https://www.epa.gov/aqs) houses data from thousands of air pollution monitoring stations operated by state, local, tribal, and federal agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AQS API offers row-level data on pollutant measurements, site metadata, and meteorological conditions, enabling research in environmental science, public health, and policy. AQS data include information about criteria pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and lead. These data are highly valuable for understanding air quality trends and analyzing the relationship between pollution exposure and health outcomes across different demographics and geographies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [RAQSAPI package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RAQSAPI/index.html) is a tool for retrieving and managing AQS data in R, facilitating direct, programmatic access to EPA’s air quality database. By interfacing with the AQS API, RAQSAPI enables users to retrieve historical air quality data for specific pollutants, states, monitoring sites, or time periods directly into R for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create Your EPA AQS API Key\n",
    "To use the AQS API, users need to register for an API key.  To register via email, update the following link with your email address (replace \"myemail@example.com\" in the example with your email address) and navigate to the link.\n",
