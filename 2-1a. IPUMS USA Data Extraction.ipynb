    "[**ipumsr**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ipumsr/index.html) A package specifically designed to interact with IPUMS datasets, including NHGIS. It allows users to define and submit data extraction requests, download data, and read it directly into R for analysis.  This notebook uses the the following functions from *ipumsr*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *set_ipums_api_key()* for setting your IPUMS API key\r\n",
    "* *get_sample_info()* for retrieving sample identification codes and descriptions for IPUMS microdata collections\n",
    "* *define_extract_micro()* for defining the parameters of an IPUMS microdata extract request to be submitted via the IPUMS API\n",
    "* *submit_exract()* for submitting an extract request via the IPUMS API and return an *ipums_extract* object\n",
    "* *wait_for_extract()* wait for an extract to finish processing\n",
    "* *download_extract()* download an extract's data files\n",
    "* *read_ipums_ddi()* for reading metadata about an IPUMS microdata extract from a DDI codebook (.xml) file\n",
    "* *read_ipums_micro()* for reading data from an IPUMS microdata extract\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are working in the I-GUIDE environment, the *ipumsr* package should be already be installed.  However you will still need to load the package into your workspace using *library* base R function."

    "## 2. Metadata Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's take a look at the entire set of available datasets within the USA data repository.  The USA data available for direct extraction using the IPUMS API primairly focus on the [American Communinty Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) and [Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about/puerto-rico-community-survey.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ACS and PRCS are are annual surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that collect information on a subset of the U.S. population.  The ACS collects data on a variety of topics, including income, poverty, education, marital status, health insurance coverage, disability, occupancy, costs, tenure, and units by type.  It is a more in-depth supplement to the Decennial U.S. Census and in 2005 replaced the long-form version of the Decennial Census survey which was previously conducted every ten years.  Each year the ACS samples over 3.5 million housing units across the United States with a new sample of about 250,000 addresses drawn each month.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACS and PRCS are available as single-year datasets as well as three- and five-year summaries of the data.  The three- and five-year summary data are often used in lieu of the single-year data as they are less susceptible to anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPUMS Data also includes population counts and samples dating back to 1850 but, for this exercise, we will focus on the ACS sample data which has been the standard USA population sample survey since 2005.  Refer to the [Descriptions of IPUMS Samples](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/sampdesc.shtml) page on the IPUMS USA website for a list of all IPUMS USA data sets and their descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *get_sample_info* function form the ipumsr package returns a list of all datasets from the specified IPUMS data repository which are available to be downloaded using the ipumsr API.  We will reuqest the list of datasets from the USA (usa) repository and print the full list."
