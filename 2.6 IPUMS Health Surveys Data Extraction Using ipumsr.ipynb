    "The [IPUMS Health Surveys](https://healthsurveys.ipums.org) database offers harmonized microdata from the [National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/index.html) and the [Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)](https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb), providing detailed information on population health, healthcare access, and medical expenditures. It enables researchers to analyze trends in health outcomes, insurance coverage, and healthcare utilization across time and demographic groups. Through harmonization, IPUMS Health Surveys ensures data can be seamlessly compared across survey years, addressing changes in survey design, variable definitions, and geographic classifications.\n",

    "**From the [IPUMS Health Surveys Website](https://healthsurveys.ipums.org):** IPUMS Health Surveys provide free individual-level survey data for research purposes from two leading sources of self-reported health and health care access information: the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPUMS Health Surveys database organized into the following two subsections, based on data source:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)](https://nhis.ipums.org/nhis): The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) provides harmonized annual microdata from the 1960s to the present.\n",
    "* [Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)](https://meps.ipums.org/meps): The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) provides harmonized microdata from the longitudinal survey of U.S. health care expenditures and utilization, covering the period 1996 to the present.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the process of extracting [IPUMS Health Surveys](https://healthsurveys.ipums.org) data using the [IPUMS API](https://developer.ipums.org/docs/v2/apiprogram) via the [ipumsr R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ipumsr/index.html). Users will learn how to define, submit, and download an IPUMS Health Surveys data extract, specifying desired variables, time periods, and geographic units for analysis. By the end of this notebook, users will have the skills to efficiently acquire customized IPUMS Health Surveys datasets and prepare them for spatial and statistical workflows.\n",
