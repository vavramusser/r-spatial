    "The [**ggmap package**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmap/index.html) is a powerful tool for visualizing spatial data by combining the flexibility of ggplot2 with the ability to retrieve basemaps from online mapping services including [Stadia Maps](https://stadiamaps.com) and [Stamen Maps](https://maps.stamen.com) as well as [Google Maps](https://mapsplatform.google.com) and [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).  Designed to streamline the integration of basemaps and data layers, ggmap allows users to create high-quality, interactive, and publication-ready maps. With functions for geocoding, reverse geocoding, and map styling, ggmap enables users to overlay spatial data points, polygons, or lines onto visually appealing basemaps, making it an essential package for spatial visualization in R."
