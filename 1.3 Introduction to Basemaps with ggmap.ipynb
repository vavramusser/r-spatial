    "Creating effective maps often starts with selecting an appropriate basemap. The ggmap R package allows users to overlay data onto basemaps from sources like Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, and Stamen Maps. By combining the power of the ggplot2 ecosystem with geospatial basemap data, ggmap facilitates the creation of visually compelling and informative maps. This notebook introduces the ggmap package, demonstrates how to retrieve and display basemaps, and provides guidance on adding spatial data layers to enhance map presentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [**ggmap package**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmap/index.html) is a powerful tool for visualizing spatial data by combining the flexibility of ggplot2 with the ability to retrieve basemaps from online mapping services such as [Google Maps](https://mapsplatform.google.com), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), [Stadia Maps](https://stadiamaps.com), and [Stamen Maps](https://maps.stamen.com).  Designed to streamline the integration of basemaps and data layers, ggmap allows users to create high-quality, interactive, and publication-ready maps. With functions for geocoding, reverse geocoding, and map styling, ggmap enables users to overlay spatial data points, polygons, or lines onto visually appealing basemaps, making it an essential package for spatial visualization in R.\n",

    "A *tile server* is a system that delivers individual map tiles on demand, allowing for interactive zooming and panning on a map by dynamically fetching the relevant tiles as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) (OSM)\n",
    "* [Stadia Maps](https://stadiamaps.com) and [Stamen Maps](https://maps.stamen.com) (now part of the Stadia Maps server)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Static Maps\n",
    "A *static map* is a pre-rendered image of a map that cannot be interacted with or dynamically changed.\n",

    "\n",
    "As of mid-2018, the [Google Maps Platform](https://mapsplatform.google.com) requires a registered API key. While this alleviates previous burdens (e.g. query limits), it creates some challenges as well. The most immediate challenge for most R users is that ggmap functions that use Google’s services no longer function out of the box, since the user has to setup an account with Google, enable the relevant APIs, and then tell R about the user’s setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain an API key and enable services, go to the [Google Maps Platform](https://mapsplatform.google.com). This documentation shows you how to input the requisite information (e.g. your API key) into R, and it also shows you a few tools that can help you work with the credentialing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that since Google requires a valid credit card to use its online cloud services, this also means that anyone who obtains your key can potentially make charges to your card in the form of Google services. So be sure to not share your API key.\n",

Users should note that setting up a Google Cloud account will require a valid credit card.  Once you have set up a Google Cloud account, return to your account to set up access to the Maps Static API which you can find in the the Google API Library."
