    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the process of exploratory data analysin using with tabular data.  The notebook uses data extracted from the [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa) repository, which provides harmonized data from the U.S. Decennial Census, American Community Survey, and Puerto Rico Community Survey, and other sources.  Following data cleaning and preparation, the next step in an analysis workflow is to carry out exploratory data analyses (EDA) which will help you better understand the information contained in your data and potential relationships between variables.  EDA is often carried out as a preliminary step before more nuanced analyses like regression analysis.  This notebook will guide you through key steps in EDA, including exploring variable characteristics and relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Goals\n",
    "This notebook introduces an EDA workflow using previously-downloaded, cleaned, and prepared data from [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa) data using the [IPUMS API](https://developer.ipums.org/docs/v2/apiprogram) via the [ipumsr R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ipumsr/index.html).  This notebook is intended as a follow-up to [Data Cleaning and Preparation with IPUMS USA](https://platform.i-guide.io/notebooks/b4b29b13-d832-495d-8db7-1545a30549f1).  Users will learn how to manage outliers, identify relationships, and calculate EDA statistics for population data in R.  By the end of this notebook, users will have the skills to create their own EDA workflows for tabular IPUMS data or other population datasets for social and demographic research workflows.\n",

    "#### About the Example Data Set\n",
    "The [*ipums_usa_analysis.rds*](https://platform.i-guide.io/datasets/25de540c-44a1-4a65-b5af-c772a716e082) file contains basic demographic information (sex, age, race, educational attainment, and total personal income) on residents of the state of Michigan collected as part of the 2010 [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html).  The data has been modified from its original version during data cleaning and preparation steps carried out in [Chapter 3.1](https://platform.i-guide.io/notebooks/b4b29b13-d832-495d-8db7-1545a30549f1).  The ACS is an annual survey conducted by the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov) that collects information on a subset of the U.S. population.  It is a more in-depth supplement to the [U.S. Decennial Census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html) and in 2005 replaced the long-form version of the Decennial Census survey which was previously conducted every ten years.\n",
