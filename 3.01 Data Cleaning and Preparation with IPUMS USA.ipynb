    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the process of cleaning and preparing tabular population data for analysis.  The notebook uses data extracted from the [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa) repository, which provides harmonized data from the U.S. Decennial Census, American Community Survey, and Puerto Rico Community Survey, and other sources.  Working with large and complex datasets, like those provided by IPUMS, often requires meticulous cleaning and preparation to ensure that the data are suitable for the user's specific analysis. This notebook will guide you through key steps in this process, including importing, exploring, and transforming IPUMS data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Goals\n",
    "This notebook introduces a data cleaning workflow using previously-downloaded data from [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa) data using the [IPUMS API](https://developer.ipums.org/docs/v2/apiprogram) via the [ipumsr R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ipumsr/index.html).  This notebook is intended as a follow-up to [IPUMS USA Data Extraction Using ipumsr](https://platform.i-guide.io/notebooks/ab5cad39-6d00-43d2-bc51-17fd4e6b98f2).  Users will learn how to clean and recode common continuous and categorical variables used in population data in R.  By the end of this notebook, users will have the skills to create their own workflows cleaning and preparing tabular IPUMS data or other population datasets for social and demographic research workflows.\n",

    "#### About the Example Data Set\n",
    "The [*ipums_usa_example.rds*](https://github.com/vavramusser/r-spatial/blob/main/ipums_usa_example.csv) file contains basic demographic information (sex, age, race, educational attainment, and total personal income) on residents of the state of Michigan collected as part of the 2010 [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html).  The ACS is an annual survey conducted by the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov) that collects information on a subset of the U.S. population.  It is a more in-depth supplement to the [U.S. Decennial Census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html) and in 2005 replaced the long-form version of the Decennial Census survey which was previously conducted every ten years.\n",

    "The high-level summary shows us a few potential issues with these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **All variables are coded as numeric, even though many of them are actually categorical.**  It is very common to code categorical variables using numeric codes but it is important to remember that these categorical variables are useless without data labels or a codebook reference.  Fortunately, the IPUMS extraction and download process included metadata for our data, which includes labels for relevant variables.  We can also refer to the [IPUMS USA Online Data Finder](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/group/demog) to find detailed information on each of our variables.  It is a good data stewardship practice to always have the codebook or other reference material nearby while performing the data cleaning process.\n",
    "2. **There are no missing values.**  If there were missing values in the data they would be indicated by an \"NA\" count for each variable.  While it is possible that our data actually has no missing values, it is also very possible that missing values are specified with a specific code.  Especailly with very large and complex datasets, it is important to retain skepticism about the lack of missing values and review each variable and its corresponding labels and codebook during the cleaning process.\n",
    "3. **The largest total income (INCTOT) value is 9999999.**  While it is possible that this is the actual maximum total income value in the dataset, it is more likely that this is a [topcoded reference value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-coded) or a missing value code.  Values in multiples of 9s, e.g. \"999\" or \"9999999\" are commonly used to indicate a topcoded value, missing, or other special circumstance.\n",
    "4. **The smalles total income (INCTOT) value is negative.**  What does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will review each of the demographic variables, keeping these potential issues at the front of our mind as we go.  The cleaning process will involve looking for and managing and issues with the data, such as missing values or values which need to be recoded, as well as reorganizing variables to make them easier to use or to suit the needs of our project.\n",
