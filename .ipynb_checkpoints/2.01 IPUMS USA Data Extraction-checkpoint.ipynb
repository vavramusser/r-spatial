    "## Introduction\n",
    "The [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa) database offers harmonized microdata from the [U.S. Decennial Census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html) and the [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html). It provides detailed, individual-level records on population demographics, economic activity, housing conditions, and social characteristics, enabling the analysis of trends in American society across time and space. Through harmonization, IPUMS USA allows data to be seamlessly compared across census years, despite changes in survey design, geographic boundaries, and variable definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**From the [IPUMS USA Website](https://usa.ipums.org/usa):** IPUMS USA collects, preserves and harmonizes United States Census microdata and provides easy access to this data with enhanced documentation. Data includes Decennial Censuses from 1790 to 2010 and American Community Surveys (ACS) from 2000 to the present.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the process of extracting [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa) data using the [IPUMS API](https://developer.ipums.org/docs/v2/apiprogram) via the [ipumsr R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ipumsr/index.html). Users will learn how to define, submit, and download an IPUMS USA data extract, specifying desired variables, time periods, and geographic units for analysis. By the end of this notebook, users will have the skills to efficiently acquire customized IPUMS USA datasets and prepare them for spatial and statistical workflows.\n",
