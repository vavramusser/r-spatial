    "Proximity analysis is a critical aspect of spatial analysis, enabling researchers to evaluate distances between spatial features, assess accessibility, and identify relationships between locations.  Proximity analysis is widely used in accessibility studies, urban planning, environmental research, and many other fields.\n",
