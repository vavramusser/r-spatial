    "## Introduction\n",
    "Visualization is a critical step in spatial analysis, enabling us to explore and communicate patterns in spatial data effectively. This notebook focuses on quick visualization techniques, which are essential during the exploratory phase of analysis. By visualizing your data early on, you can uncover trends, detect outliers, and gain insights that inform the rest of your workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the foundation for the rest of the \"Mapping and Visualization\" chapter. Later notebooks will dive deeper into working with point and polygon data, choropleth mapping, and advanced tools like leaflet and tmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Goals\n",
    "Learn how to create quick, static plots of spatial data.  Use R's sf package to handle spatial data efficiently.  Leverage ggplot2 for clean and customizable visualizations.  Address common challenges, such as working with projections and large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll be able to: Quickly visualize spatial data to assess its structure and content.  Use plotting techniques that set the stage for more advanced mapping.\n",
