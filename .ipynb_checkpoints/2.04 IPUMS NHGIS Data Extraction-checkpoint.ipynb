    "## Introduction\n",
    "The [IPUMS NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org) database offers harmonized summary data and geographic boundary files from U.S. censuses and surveys, providing a resource for spatial analysis of demographic, social, and economic trends. It enables users to access aggregated data at various geographic levels, such as states, counties, and census tracts, facilitating the exploration of population dynamics and regional patterns over time. Through harmonization, IPUMS NHGIS ensures that data can be seamlessly compared across years, despite changes in geographic boundaries, variable definitions, and survey methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**From the [IPUMS NHGIS Webpage](https://www.nhgis.org):** The National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) provides easy access to summary tables and time series of population, housing, agriculture, and economic data, along with GIS-compatible mapping files, for years from 1790 through the present and for all levels of U.S. census geography, including states, counties, tracts, and blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the process of extracting [IPUMS NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org) data using the [IPUMS API](https://developer.ipums.org/docs/v2/apiprogram) via the [ipumsr R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ipumsr/index.html). Users will learn how to define, submit, and download an IPUMS NHGIS data extract, specifying desired variables, time periods, and geographic units for analysis. By the end of this notebook, users will have the skills to efficiently acquire customized IPUMS NHGIS datasets and prepare them for spatial and statistical workflows.\n",
