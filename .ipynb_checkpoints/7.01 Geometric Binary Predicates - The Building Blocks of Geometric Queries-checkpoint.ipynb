    "## Introduction\n",
    "Spatial analyses often begin with questions about relationships between geographic features: *Does one feature lie within another? Do features overlap or share a boundary? Does one feature entirely contain another?* These questions, collectively referred to as **geometric queries**, are foundational to many workflows in spatial data science and the social sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional GIS software like ArcGIS or QGIS, these relationships are often evaluated visually through tools like *Select by Location* or specific geoprocessing tools. In the R programming environment, we move beyond visual interpretation by using well-defined geometric functions. These functions allow for reproducible, automated, and scalable workflows, making them ideal for complex analyses or large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces three commonly used **geometric binary predicate** functions from the [**`sf`**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) package:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *`st_contains`* checks if one feature completely contains another (inverse of *`st_within`*)\n",
    "* *`st_within`* checks if one feature is entirely contained within another (inverse of *`st_contains`*)\n",
    "* *`st_intersects`* checks if two features share any part of their space\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Geometric Binary Predicate?\n",
    "A **geometric binary predicate** is a function that takes two sets of geometric features (points, lines, or polygons) as input and returns a vector (list) of boolean value (true or false) based on the spatial relationship between the two feature sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Binary** – It operates on two geometric objects.\n",
    "* **Geometric** – It is related to spatial relationships such as intersection, containment, adjacency, etc.\n",
    "* **Predicate** – It evaluates a condition and returns a boolean (true or false) result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometric binary predicates are crucial in spatial analysis, spatial databases, GIS, and computational geometry because they enable **efficient spatial reasoning, querying, and decision-making** based on **geometric relationships**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of Geometric Binary Predicates**\n",
    "* **Intersects(A, B)** → true if A and B share at least one point\n",
    "* **Touches(A, B)** → true if A and B share a boundary but not their interior\n",
    "* **Contains(A, B)** → true if A completely encloses B\n",
    "* **Within(A, B)** → true if A is completely inside B\n",
    "* **Disjoint(A, B)** → true if A and B have no points in common\n",
    "* **Equals(A, B)** → true if A and B represent the same geometric shape\n",
    "\n",
    "In R spatial analysis, particularly in social science applications, geometric binary predicates are **not typically used in isolation**. Instead, they are the building blocks for more advanced analyses such as **spatial joins**, **overlays**, **filtering operations**, and **proximity calculations**. These functions allow users to analyze relationships between spatial entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In later notebooks, we will explore how to incorporate these foundational spatial relationship functions into more complex workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Geometric Queries Matter for Social Science Workflows?\n",
    "In the social sciences, spatial data often represent individuals, households, neighborhoods, or administrative units like census tracts. Understanding spatial relationships among these features can help answer questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are schools located within specific catchment zones?\n",
    "* How many health clinics fall within high-poverty neighborhoods?\n",
    "* Do city boundaries overlap with environmentally protected areas?\n",
    "\n",
    "These types of questions can be addressed systematically and reproducibly using geometric queries, which abstract the spatial relationships into logical comparisons. Mastering these concepts is critical for transitioning from traditional GIS tools to programmatic workflows, where such functions are key to enabling scalable and efficient analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Goals\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the purpose and functionality of the binary geometric query **`sf`** functions *`st_contains`*, *`st_intersects`*, and *`st_within`*.\n",
    "* Apply these functions to evaluate spatial relationships between geographic features in R.\n",
    "* Recognize how these functions fit into larger workflows, such as spatial joins and proximity analyses.\n",
    "* Appreciate the broader set of geometric comparison functions available in the **`sf`** package.\n",

    "## 2. Exploring Geometric Binary Predicate Functions from the sf Package\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will explore [*binary predicate functions*](https://rdrr.io/cran/sf/man/geos_binary_pred.html) by stepping through the process of using them in practical examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [*binary predicate functions*](https://rdrr.io/cran/sf/man/geos_binary_pred.html), (including [`st_contains`](https://rdrr.io/cran/sf/man/geos_binary_pred.html), [`st_intersects`](https://rdrr.io/cran/sf/man/geos_binary_pred.html), [`st_within`](https://rdrr.io/cran/sf/man/geos_binary_pred.html), and others) will return an interesting type of data object called a **sparse geometry binary predicate (*sgbp*)** which represents the relationships between the two sets of features.  An *sgbp* is essentailly a list of feature index values (from the first set of features) each with a corresponding list of feature index values (from the second set of features) - a list of lists.  That can be a confusing data structure to imagine, but stepping through this section will help you to understand and visualize the structure of this type of data and how it is essential for spatial analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "An *sgbp* may seem like a convoluded and abstract way of representing the relationship between two sets of features but it is a very simple and lightweight way for a computer to store and understand a large set of relationships.  For the most part, you, the user, will not need to directly interact with *sgbp* objects because you likely will not have a reason to work with any of the [*binary predicate functions*](https://rdrr.io/cran/sf/man/geos_binary_pred.html) by themselves.  Instead, you will use these functions, and their output, in conjunction with key spatial query functions including spatial subsetting and joining ([`st_join`](https://rdrr.io/cran/sf/man/st_join.html), [`st_filter`](https://rdrr.io/cran/sf/man/st_join.html) and [`st_crop`](https://rdrr.io/cran/sf/man/st_crs.html)), spatial aggregation and geometry manipulation ([`st_union`](https://rdrr.io/cran/sf/man/geos_combine.html) and [`st_combine`](https://rdrr.io/cran/sf/man/geos_combine.html)), geometric binary operations ([`st_intersects`](https://rdrr.io/cran/sf/man/geos_binary_ops.html) and [`st_difference`](https://rdrr.io/cran/sf/man/geos_binary_ops.html)), spatial relationships ([`st_relate`](https://rdrr.io/cran/sf/man/st_read.html)), and others.\n",
