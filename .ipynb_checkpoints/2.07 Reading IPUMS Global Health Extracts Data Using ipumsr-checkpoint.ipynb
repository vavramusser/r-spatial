    "The [IPUMS Global Health](https://globalhealth.ipums.org) database offers harmonized microdata from international health surveys, including the [Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)](https://dhsprogram.com), [Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA)](https://www.pmadata.org) surveys, and the [Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS)](https://mics.unicef.org). It provides detailed information on maternal and child health, family planning, nutrition, and access to healthcare across countries. Through harmonization, IPUMS Global Health enables researchers to compare health outcomes and determinants across countries and survey years, overcoming challenges posed by differences in survey design, variable definitions, and geographic contexts.\n",

    "**From the [IPUMS Global Health Website](https://globalhealth.ipums.org):** IPUMS Global Health provides integrated international health survey data at no cost for research and educational purposes from three data series: the Demographic Health Surveys (DHS), the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster surveys (MICS), and Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA).\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPUMS Global Health database organized into the following three subsections, based on data source:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)](https://www.idhsdata.org/idhs): Integrated Demographic and Health Surveys from The DHS Program, currently covering Africa and South Asian surveys from the 1980s to the present.\n",
    "* [Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA)](https://pma.ipums.org/pma): Integrated PMA surveys on fertility, contraception, hygiene, and health, administered frequently to monitor trends in select high-fertility countries.\n",
    "* [Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS)](https://mics.ipums.org/mics): Integrated MICS surveys covering child health and well-being.\n",
