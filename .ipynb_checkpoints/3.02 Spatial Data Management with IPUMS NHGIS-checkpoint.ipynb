    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the process of cleaning and preparing spatial data for analysis.  The notebook uses data extracted from the [IPUMS National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS)](https://www.nhgis.org) repository, which provides harmonized data from the U.S. Decennial Census, American Community Survey, and other sources.  Working with spatial data, like the data included in the IPUMS NHGIS repository, requires specalized management of the complex relationships between geographic boundaries and attribute data, as well as attention to the nuances of georeferenced data. This notebook will guide you through steps in a typical spatial data management process, including importing, joining, and preparing tabular and boundary data to create clean, analysis-ready spatial datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Goals\n",
    "This notebook introduces a typical spatial data management workflow using previously-downloaded [IPUMS NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org) data using the [IPUMS API](https://developer.ipums.org/docs/v2/apiprogram) via the [ipumsr R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ipumsr/index.html).  This notebook is intended as a follow-up to [2.4 IPUMS NHGIS Data Extraction Using ipumsr](https://platform.i-guide.io/notebooks/be08e56e-1c08-458e-a230-263c64d386bc).  By the end of this notebook, users will have the skills to create their own workflows managing spatial NHGIS IPUMS data or other spatial for social and demographic research workflows.\n",

    "  * You can also download the zipped shapefile *ipums_nhgis_example.zip* including the four *ipums_nhgis_example* shapefile files from [the I-GUIDE platform](https://platform.i-guide.io/datasets/b033e365-cb1f-41d6-ad99-e6a13c41127c) or [Kate's GitHub](https://github.com/vavramusser/r-spatial/blob/main/ipums_nhgis_example.zip).\n",

    "#### About the Example Data Set\n",
    "The [*ipums_nhgis_example*](https://github.com/vavramusser/r-spatial/blob/main/ipums_usa_example.csv) shapefile contains total population counts from the 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 [U.S. Decennial Censuses](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html) for all counties in the state of California, standardized to 2010 geographic boundaries.  The United States [Decennial Census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html) is a population and housing count conducted by the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov) every ten years. The Census aims to count every person living in the United States and its territories, collecting basic demographic information such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, and household relationships.  It is designed to provide a comprehensive snapshot of the nation's population and housing characteristics at a specific point in time.\n",
