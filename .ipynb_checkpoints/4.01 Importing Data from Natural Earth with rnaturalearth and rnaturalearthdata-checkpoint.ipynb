    "## Introduction\n",
    "[Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com) is a public domain map dataset available at multiple scales, featuring a wide variety of cultural and physical geographic data. The [rnaturalearth](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rnaturalearth/index.html) and [rnaturalearthdata](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rnaturalearthdata/index.html) R packages simplify the process of accessing, downloading, and using these datasets directly within R. These datasets are particularly valuable for social sciences research involving spatial data analysis due to their compatibility with R's spatial data tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Goals\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore how to use [rnaturalearth](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rnaturalearth/index.html) and [rnaturalearthdata](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rnaturalearthdata/index.html) to import data from Natural Earth. We will focus on reviewing available datasets, downloading them, and saving the data for further analysis. By the end of this notebook, you will have a workflow to efficiently access and visualize Natural Earth data, including cultural and physical features such as country and boundary polygons.\n",
