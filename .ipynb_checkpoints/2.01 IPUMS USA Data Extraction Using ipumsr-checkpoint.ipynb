    "## Introduction\n",
    "The [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa) database offers harmonized microdata from the [U.S. Decennial Census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html), [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html), and [Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about/puerto-rico-community-survey.html). It provides detailed, individual-level records on population demographics, economic activity, housing conditions, and social characteristics, enabling the analysis of trends in American society across time and space. Through harmonization, IPUMS USA allows data to be seamlessly compared across census years, despite changes in survey design, geographic boundaries, and variable definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**From the [IPUMS USA Website](https://usa.ipums.org/usa):** IPUMS USA collects, preserves and harmonizes United States Census microdata and provides easy access to this data with enhanced documentation. Data includes Decennial Censuses from 1790 to 2010 and American Community Surveys (ACS) from 2000 to the present.\n",

    "This notebook introduces the process of extracting [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa) data using the [IPUMS API](https://developer.ipums.org/docs/v2/apiprogram) via the [ipumsr R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ipumsr/index.html). Users will learn how to define, submit, and download an IPUMS USA data extract, specifying desired variables, time periods, and geographic units for analysis. By the end of this notebook, users will have the skills to efficiently acquire customized IPUMS USA datasets and prepare them for spatial and statistical workflows.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before submitting an IPUMS data extraction request, it’s essential to ensure the parameters of the extraction definition are set up correctly.  The extraction definition specifies the sample, variables, and other options.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is your first time using the IPUMS API in R, or if you are setting up a new data extract for a new project, it is a good idea to start by exploring the available data which can be done using the *ipumsr* package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2a. Review the List of Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's take a look at the entire list of datasets available from the [IPUMS USA data repository](https://usa.ipums.org/usa).  The USA data available for direct extraction using the IPUMS API include the [American Communinty Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) and [Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about/puerto-rico-community-survey.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ACS and PRCS are are annual surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that collect information on a subset of the U.S. population.  The ACS collects data on a variety of topics, including income, poverty, education, marital status, health insurance coverage, disability, occupancy, costs, tenure, and units by type.  It is a more in-depth supplement to the Decennial U.S. Census and in 2005 replaced the long-form version of the Decennial Census survey which was previously conducted every ten years.  Each year the ACS samples over 3.5 million housing units across the United States with a new sample of about 250,000 addresses drawn each month.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACS and PRCS are available as single-year datasets as well as three- and five-year summaries of the data.  The three- and five-year summary data are often used in lieu of the single-year data as they are less susceptible to anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPUMS Data also includes population counts and samples dating back to 1850 but, for this exercise, we will focus on the ACS sample data which has been the standard USA population sample survey since 2005.  Refer to the [Descriptions of IPUMS Samples](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/sampdesc.shtml) page on the IPUMS USA website for a list of all IPUMS USA data sets and their descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this step, we will use the [*get_sample_info*](https://rdrr.io/cran/ipumsr/man/get_sample_info.html) function from the [**ipumsr**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ipumsr/index.html) package.  This function will return a list of all datasets from the specified IPUMS data repository which are available to be downloaded using the ipumsr API.  Since we are focusing on IPUMS USA, we will specify that we want to view all available samples from the IPUMS USA repository by passing *\"usa\"* to the function.  This code stores the metadata from all available samples in the IPUMS USA repository to the object *metadata_usa*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**★ Pro Tip:** You can use the [*get_sample_info*](https://rdrr.io/cran/ipumsr/man/get_sample_info.html) function to retrieve metadata for any of the available IPUMS repositories by changing the database reference code."

Since we are using the 2010 ACS sample for this example, you should select the 2010 ACS sample within the live search platform.  What variables are available, and the code used for the variables, may differ based on your selected sample, so it is important to be specific.\n",
