    "Selecting the appropriate data source is critical for effective spatial analysis. This notebook compares the key features, strengths, and limitations of the data sources introduced in this chapter, including IPUMS, Natural Earth, OpenStreetMap, and others. By understanding the scope and applications of each dataset, users can make informed decisions about which data sources best suit their research objectives. This notebook also provides guidance on integrating multiple datasets for comprehensive spatial workflows."
