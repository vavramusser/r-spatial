    "## Introduction\n",
    "The [IPUMS Time Use](https://timeuse.ipums.org) database offers harmonized microdata from the [American Time Use Survey (ATUS)](https://www.bls.gov/tus) and international time use surveys, providing insights into how individuals allocate their time across various activities. It includes detailed records on work, caregiving, leisure, and daily routines, enabling analysis of time-use patterns and trends across different populations and time periods. Through harmonization, IPUMS Time Use ensures data can be seamlessly compared across survey years and countries, addressing differences in activity coding, survey methodologies, and geographic contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**From the [IPUMS Time Use Website](https://timeuse.ipums.org):** These projects provide free individual-level time use data for research purposes. The data extract systems make it easy to create data sets containing time use and other variables a user needs.\n",

Before searching for variables, be sure to click the **Select Samples** button in the top-left corner of the search platform and select the samples you are planning to use.  Since we are using the ATUS 2020 sample for this example, you should select the ATUS 2020 sample within the search platform.  What variables are available, and the codes used for the variables, may differ based on your selected sample, so it is important to be specific.\n",

If not, the best place to start is by exploring the web-based [**IPUMS AHTUS Data Extract Platform**](https://www.ahtusdata.org/ahtus-action/variables/group) to see what variables are available and identify the appropriate variable codes.  Before searching for variables, be sure to click the **Select Samples** button in the top-left corner of the search platform and select the samples you are planning to use.  Since we are using the 2010 ATUS sample for this example, you should select the 2010 ATUS sample within the search platform.  What variables are available, and the codes used for the variables, may differ based on your selected sample, so it is important to be specific.\n",
