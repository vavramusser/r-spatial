    "## 2. Explore Available Data from OpenStreetMap\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will be using the **osmdata** R package to access OSM data via the *Overpass API*, OSM's native API.  Advanced users can learn more about the API by reviewing the [Overpass API User's Manual](https://dev.overpass-api.de/overpass-doc/en).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2a. Review the List Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the Overapp API, you will need to specify the type of feature or features you are interested in extracting.  OSM includes a wide range and variety of features and users have access to all data available from the OSM platform.  To specify the specific feature type you are interested in, you will need to pass the feature's key to your API call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the [Map Features page from the OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features) to review available feature types and their respective keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "While using OSM and OSM data, rememember that OSM has been populated by volunteered user input.  Therefore, while OSM is a fantastic data source, you should not necessairly assume that the data included in OSM is exhaustive.  Additionally, many OSM features are region- or culture-specifc and may not be relevant for all queries.  Features might also have slightly different meanings in different regions, due to differences in cultural or regional definitions of terms and concepts.  Some feature types are less specific than others and many feature types overlap one another.  A given feature may be tagged with more than one feature tag.  OSM data users should remember that feature categorization might not be uniform, even in the same geographic area.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, OSM includes feature tags for amenities, including the *sustenance* sub-cateogry which includes feature tags for *bar*, *biergarten*, *cafe*, *fast_food*, *food_court*, *ice_cream*, *pub*, and *restaurant* and the specific tags used for a given feature is at the discretion of the OSM volunteer contributors and editors.  A informal-type location which serves casual meals and beverages including alcohol may arguably be tagged using some combination of one or more of *bar*, *biergarten*, *cafe*, *fast_food*, *pub*, and *restaurant*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users should consider the likely volume of users who are interested in contributing to and updating OSM's data for their specific area of interest.  A major city or touist destination in a country with a high volume of OSM users, such as the United States, Germany, and Indonesia, is likely to see see a high volume of contributions, updates, and corrections and is more likely to be up-to-date and complete.  While remote areas, areas with low population, informal settlements, and countries with low OSM useage might see little to no OSM contribution or may be slow to update and correct existing information.  Some countries, such as North Korea, Pakistan, and Somalia have low OSM data due to government restrictions."
