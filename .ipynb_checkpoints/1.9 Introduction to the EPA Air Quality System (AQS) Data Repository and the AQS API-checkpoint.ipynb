    "The [**Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS)**](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html) provides access to detailed, historical data on ambient air quality collected across the United States. Developed and maintained by the [United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov), the [Air Quality System (AQS)](https://www.epa.gov/aqs) houses data from thousands of air pollution monitoring stations operated by state, local, tribal, and federal agencies.\n",

    "The EPA Air Quality System (AQS) is a comprehensive repository of air quality monitoring data collected across the United States. Managed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the AQS includes detailed information on pollutants such as PM2.5, ozone, and carbon monoxide, as well as the geographic locations of monitoring sites. This notebook introduces the AQS, outlines its data structure, and demonstrates how to access and integrate AQS data into spatial analyses using R.\n",

AQS data include information about criteria pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and lead. For a complete list of all pollutants available from the AQS data repository, refer to the [AQS Codes and Descriptions List](https://www.epa.gov/aqs/aqs-code-list)."
