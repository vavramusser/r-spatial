    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll explore how to create a choropleth map using population data by county. [Choropleth maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) are thematic maps where areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to a variable of interest, in this case, population data. These maps help visualize spatial distributions and identify patterns, such as population density variations across geographic areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will use NHGIS population data by county based on the 2020 US Decennial Census.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Goals\n",
    "At the end of Chapter 2.4: IPUMS NHGIS Data Extraction Using ipumsr, you saved your data extraction as two file formats *ipums_nhgis_example.rds* and *ipums_nhgis_example.csv*.  You will need these files to run this notebook.  If you are working throuhg this chapter without previously completing, Chapter 1.2, you will need to copy the *ipums_nhgis_example.rds* file into your working directory prior to running this notebook.\n",
