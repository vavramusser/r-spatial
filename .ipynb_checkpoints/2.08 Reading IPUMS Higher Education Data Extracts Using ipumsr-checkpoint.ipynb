    "The [IPUMS Higher Education](https://highered.ipums.org/highered) database offers harmonized microdata from surveys focused on postsecondary education, workforce outcomes, and research activities from the [National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG)](https://ncses.nsf.gov/surveys/national-survey-college-graduates), [National Survey of Recent College Graduates (NSRCG)](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvyrecentgrads), and [Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR)](https://ncses.nsf.gov/surveys/doctorate-recipients). It provides detailed information on educational attainment, employment, and demographic characteristics, enabling analysis of trends in higher education and its impacts on the labor market. Through harmonization, IPUMS Higher Education ensures data can be seamlessly compared across survey years, addressing differences in variable definitions, survey design, and geographic classifications.\n",

    "**From the [IPUMS Higher Education Website](https://highered.ipums.org/highered):** IPUMS Higher Ed disseminates data from the [Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT)](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/sestat), the leading surveys for studying the science and engineering (STEM) workforce in the United States. Data from the National Surveys of College Graduates (NSCG), Recent College Graduates (NSRCG), and Doctorate Recipients (SDR) are integrated from 1993 to the present.\n",

By the end of this notebook, users will have the skills to prepare IPUMS Higher Education datasets for spatial and statistical workflows.\n",
