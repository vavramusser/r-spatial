    "Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based platform for geospatial analysis that provides access to a vast catalog of satellite imagery and environmental datasets. GEE enables scalable, high-performance processing of large geospatial datasets, making it ideal for applications like land cover classification, climate change analysis, and environmental monitoring. This notebook introduces GEE, highlights its capabilities, and demonstrates how to integrate it into spatial workflows in R.\n",
