    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The [***sf***](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) R package was designed to provide support for working with the [simple features (sf)](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html) standard for geographic [vector data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics) representation within the R ecosystem.  The *sf* package was first released in 2016 and within a few years had largely surpassed the [***sp***](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html) package (first released in 2005) as the most commonly used geographic data representation for vector data in R.  In additon to providing support for the simple features data standard, *sf* includes a wide range of functions for working with spatial vector data in R.  If you are accustomed to working with spatial data using traditional [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) desktop software such as [QGIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QGIS) or [ArCGIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcGIS), you will find analogues to the typical analysis, query, selection, geoprocessing, and visualization GIS tools within the *sf* package.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From the [Simple Features for R](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html) Webpage\n",
    "*[Simple features (sf)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features) or [simple feature access](https://www.ogc.org/publications/standard/sfa) refers to a formal standard ([ISO 19125-1:2004](https://www.iso.org/standard/40114.html)) that describes how objects in the real world can be represented in computers, with emphasis on the spatial geometry of these objects. It also describes how such objects can be stored in and retrieved from databases, and which geometrical operations should be defined for them.  The standard is widely implemented in spatial databases (such as [PostGIS](https://postgis.net)), commercial GIS (e.g., [ESRI ArcGIS](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home)) and forms the vector data basis for libraries such as [GDAL](https://gdal.org/en/stable).*\n",

    "### Notebook Goals\n",
    "This notebook will introduce you to the [***sf***](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) package and working with geographic vector data in the [simple features (sf)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features) data standard.  This notebook is only intended to be a very quick introductin to the *sf* package as many more *sf* functions will be introduced in later notebooks, primairly in the **Mapping and Visualization** and **Spatial Analyses** chapters.\n",

    "### ✨ Prerequisites ✨\n",
