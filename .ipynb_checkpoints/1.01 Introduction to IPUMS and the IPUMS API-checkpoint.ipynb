    "The [**IPUMS (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series)**](https://www.ipums.org) provides access to high-quality, harmonized data on population and health from around the world. Developed and maintained by the [Institute for Social Research and Data Innovation (ISRDI)](https://isrdi.umn.edu) at the [University of Minnesota's Minnesota Population Center (MPC)](https://pop.umn.edu), IPUMS datasets cover a range of demographic, health, and geographic topics that support research in fields like public health, economics, geography, and social sciences. IPUMS data offerings include U.S. Census data, global demographic surveys, and health datasets, all standardized across time and location to allow for easy cross-temporal and cross-national comparisons.\n",

    "The [**ipumsr package**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ipumsr/index.html) is a tool for loading, managing, and analyzing IPUMS data within R. Designed to simplify the process of working with IPUMS extracts, ipumsr provides functions to import data, handle metadata, and apply labeled values directly, making it easier to move from raw data to analysis. This package supports both the classic rectangular datasets from IPUMS as well as more complex hierarchical files."
