    "## Introduction\n",
    "[Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system) play a foundational role in spatial data analysis. They define how data based on the three-dimensional surface of the earth can be represented in flat, two-dimensional maps. Understanding CRS is essential for working with spatial data, especially if you are working with datasets from different sources that may use different CRSs.  If you want to map more than one spatial data layer on the same map, or if you want to use multiple spatial data files in the same spatial analysis workflow, you will need to ensure all layers are in the same CRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geographic vs Projected CRS\n",
    "There are two main types of CRSs: Geographic CRS and Projected CRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Geographic CRS (GCS)\n",
    "A Geographic CRS represents locations using **latitude and longitude** on a three-dimensional sphere or ellipsoid.  Geographic CRS are best for storing and displaying global data, but are not ideal for area measurements due to local distortions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Geographic CRS**\n",
    "* When dealing with global datasets (e.g., satellite data, GPS data).\n",
    "* When storing and sharing data (most GIS databases store raw data in a geographic CRS).\n",
    "* For web maps (WGS 84 is the most common for web-based applications).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drawbacks**\n",
    "* Not suitable for measuring distances or areas accurately, as degrees of latitude and longitude do not have uniform lengths across the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Projected Coordinate Reference Systems (PCS)\n",
    "A Projected CRS transforms the Earth's curved surface onto a flat, two-dimensional plane, allowing for accurate distance, area, and direction measurements.  Projected CRS use linear units (e.g. meters or feet) instead of degrees.  They are designed to minimize distortion for a **specific area** and are best for regional and local spatial analysis where accurate distance and area calculations are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Projected CRS**\n",
    "* For regional and local analysis where distance and area measurements matter (e.g., urban planning, land surveys).\n",
    "* When performing spatial operations like buffering or area calculations.\n",
    "* For maps that need to preserve distances, shapes, or areas accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drawbacks**\n",
    "* Only accurate within its defined area.  A projected CRS optimized for North America wonâ€™t work well for Europe.\n",
    "* May distort some aspects of geometry, depending on the projection type.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common CRS\n",
    "| **CRS Name** | **Type** | **Common Use Case** | **EPSG Code**\n",

    "### Tips for Choosing and Working with CRS\n",
    "\n",
    "* When mapping multiple layers or carrying out analyses that use multiple datasets, all layers must share the same CRS.\n",
    "* Certain projections minimize distortions in distance, area, or angles, which is critical for tasks like distance measurements or area calculations.\n",
    "* Some map projections are better suited for specific regions or visualization purposes.\n",
    "* No projection is perfect!  Choose one that best suits your analysis needs.\n",
    "* Always verify that the CRS information is correctly assigned, especially when working with new or imported datasets.\n",
    "* Keep track of transformations in your workflow for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Goals\n",
    "In this notebook, you will explore how to work with CRSs in R using the sf package including reprojecting spatial data between different CRSs.\n",
