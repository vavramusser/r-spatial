    "## Introduction\n",
    "The [IPUMS CPS](https://cps.ipums.org/cps) database offers harmonized microdata from the [Current Population Survey (CPS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html), a key source of information on labor force participation, employment, income, and related demographic characteristics in the United States. It provides detailed, individual-level records that enable the analysis of trends in the labor market and socioeconomic conditions over time. Through harmonization, IPUMS CPS allows data to be seamlessly compared across survey years, despite changes in questionnaire design, geographic classifications, and variable definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**From the [IPUMS CPS Website](https://cps.ipums.org/cps):** IPUMS CPS harmonizes microdata from the monthly U.S. labor force survey, the Current Population Survey (CPS), covering the period 1962 to the present. Data include demographic information, rich employment data, program participation and supplemental data on topics such as fertility, tobacco use, volunteer activities, voter registration, computer and internet use, food security, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Included in the IPUMS CPS Repository\n",
    "* Monthly [Current Population Survey (CPS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html) data from 1976 to present\n",
    "* Annual [Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/guidance/model-input-data/cpsasec.html) data from 1962 to present\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the CPS and ASEC\n",
    "The [**Current Population Survey (CPS)**](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html) and [**Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC)**](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/guidance/model-input-data/cpsasec.html) are vital surveys conducted by the U.S. [Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov) and the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov). The CPS is a monthly survey that collects labor force data, including employment, unemployment, and workforce participation, as well as demographic information. It serves as the primary source of data for calculating the U.S. unemployment rate and analyzing labor market trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ASEC is a supplement to the CPS, conducted annually in March. It expands on the core CPS topics by collecting detailed information on income, poverty, health insurance coverage, program participation, and household composition. The ASEC is a key source for evaluating the social and economic well-being of the U.S. population and is widely used for policymaking, academic research, and public understanding of economic conditions. Together, these surveys provide comprehensive insights into the labor market and socioeconomic conditions across the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Goals\n",
    "This notebook introduces the process of extracting [IPUMS CPS](https://cps.ipums.org/cps) data using the [IPUMS API](https://developer.ipums.org/docs/v2/apiprogram) via the [ipumsr R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ipumsr/index.html). Users will learn how to define, submit, and download an IPUMS CPS data extract, specifying desired variables, time periods, and geographic units for analysis. By the end of this notebook, users will have the skills to efficiently acquire customized IPUMS CPS datasets and prepare them for spatial and statistical workflows.\n",

Since we are using the 2020 ASEC sample for this example, you should select the 2020 ASEC sample within the search platform.
