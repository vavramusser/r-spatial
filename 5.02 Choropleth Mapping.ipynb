    "In this notebook, we’ll explore how to create a choropleth map using population data by county. [Choropleth maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) are thematic maps where areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to a variable of interest, in this case, population data. These maps help visualize spatial distributions and identify patterns, such as population density variations across geographic areas.\n",
