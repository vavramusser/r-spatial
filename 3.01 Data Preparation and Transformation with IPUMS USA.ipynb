Fortunately, the IPUMS extraction and download process included metadata for our data, which includes labels for relevant variables.  We can also refer to the [IPUMS website](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/group/demog) for detailed information on each variable.

While it is possible that our data actually has no missing values, it is also very possible that missing values are coded with a specific coding as mentioned in the section above.  Especailly with very large and complex datasets, we should retain a skepticism about the lack of missing values and review each variable and its corresponding labels and codebook during the cleaning process.\n",
    "3. **The largest total income (INCTOT) value is 9999999.**  While it is possible that this is the actual maximum total income value in the dataset, it is more likely that this is a topcoded reference value.  Often values in multiples of 9s, e.g. \"999\" or \"9999999\" indicate a topcoded value, missing, or other special value.  This quick summary overview reminds us that when we clean the INCTOT variable, we should be doubly sure to reference the codebook and data labels.\n",
