    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Choropleth maps are one of the most recognizable and widely used types of thematic maps. From election results to disease prevalence, from income distribution to educational attainment, choropleths are the go-to method for showing how values vary across geographic areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "But creating an effective choropleth requires more than just coloring areas by data values. You need to understand **data classification**, **color scheme selection**, **normalization strategies**, and **design principles** that can make the difference between a map that reveals patterns and one that misleads.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to choropleth mapping in R, covering both the technical implementation and the cartographic theory that makes them effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll explore how to create a choropleth map using population data by county. [Choropleth maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) are thematic maps where areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to a variable of interest, in this case, population data. These maps help visualize spatial distributions and identify patterns, such as population density variations across geographic areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will use NHGIS population data by county based on the 2020 US Decennial Census."

    "### What is a Choropleth Map?\n",
    "\n",
    "A [**choropleth map**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) (from Greek *choros* \"area\" + *plethos* \"multitude\") uses color or shading to represent the magnitude of a variable across geographic areas. Key characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Area-based:** Values are mapped to polygons (counties, states, census tracts, etc.)\n",
    "- **Univariate:** Shows one variable at a time\n",
    "- **Pattern-focused:** Designed to reveal spatial patterns and clusters\n",
    "- **Comparative:** Allows visual comparison across areas\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- Population density by county\n",
    "- Unemployment rates by state\n",
    "- Median income by census tract\n",
    "- COVID-19 case rates by region\n",
    "- Election results by precinct"

    "### When to Use Choropleth Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use choropleths when:**\n",
    "- ✅ Data is associated with enumeration units (areas)\n",
    "- ✅ You want to show spatial patterns or clustering\n",
    "- ✅ Comparing values across regions is important\n",
    "- ✅ The variable is a rate, ratio, or density\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid choropleths when:**\n",
    "- ❌ Data represents counts of discrete phenomena (use proportional symbols instead)\n",
    "- ❌ Areas vary dramatically in size (can mislead perception)\n",
    "- ❌ Precise values matter more than patterns (use a table)\n",
    "- ❌ Data is point-based, not area-based"

    "- Light → Dark or Saturated color\n",
    "- Examples: YlOrRd, Blues, Viridis, Greens\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diverging Schemes (low ← middle → high):**\n",

    "\n",
    "**General Rules:**\n",
    "- ❌ Never use rainbow (perceptually non-uniform)\n",
    "- ✅ Always test for colorblind accessibility\n",
    "- ✅ Use colorbrewer or viridis palettes\n",
    "- ✅ Limit to 5-7 classes for legibility\n",
    "- ✅ Ensure sufficient contrast\n",

    "**Data:**\n",
    "- [ ] Variable is normalized (rate/density, not raw count)\n",
    "- [ ] Classification method is appropriate for distribution\n",
    "- [ ] Number of classes is reasonable (usually 4-7)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Colors:**\n",
    "- [ ] Color scheme matches data type (sequential/diverging)\n",
    "- [ ] Colors are colorblind-friendly\n",
    "- [ ] Sufficient contrast between adjacent classes\n",
    "- [ ] Legend is clear and readable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design:**\n",
    "- [ ] Borders are appropriate (often no borders for clean look)\n",
    "- [ ] Title clearly states what's being shown\n",
    "- [ ] Data source is cited\n",
    "- [ ] Map projection is appropriate\n",

    "\n",
    "**❌ Don't:**\n",
    "1. Map raw counts (almost always misleading)\n",
    "2. Use too many classes (>7 hard to distinguish)\n",
    "3. Use rainbow color schemes\n",
    "4. Use red-green combinations\n",
    "5. Forget to show missing data\n",
    "6. Use equal interval for skewed data\n",
    "7. Omit the data source\n",
    "8. Make legend text too small\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Do:**\n",
    "1. Normalize by area or population\n",
    "2. Test multiple classification methods\n",
    "3. Use colorbrewer or viridis palettes\n",
    "4. Show your data distribution (histogram)\n",
    "5. Include clear title and legend\n",

    "\n",
    "Choropleths can be misleading:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Weight Problem:**\n",
    "- Large areas draw attention even if values are low\n",
    "- Small urban areas may be overlooked even if values are high\n",
    "- Solution: Consider cartograms or proportional symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP):**\n",
    "- Patterns change depending on how areas are defined\n",
    "- County vs. census tract vs. zip code show different patterns\n",
    "- Solution: Acknowledge this limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification Manipulation:**\n",
    "- Different methods can show very different patterns\n",
    "- Can be used to support predetermined conclusions\n",
    "- Solution: Show multiple methods, explain your choice\n",
    "\n",
    "**False Precision:**\n",
    "- Sharp boundaries imply sudden changes that rarely exist\n",
    "- Reality is usually more gradual\n",
    "- Solution: Acknowledge smoothing, consider interpolated surfaces"
