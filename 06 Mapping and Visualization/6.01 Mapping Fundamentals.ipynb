    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Map development is a key step in the spatial analysis process.  A well-crafted map can reveal patterns, relationships, and proceeses that might be hidden or difficult to observe in tables and traditional data visualuzations.  But before you can create clean, sophisticated, publication-ready cartographic products, you need to master the fundamentals of spatial visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces foundational mapping concepts and techniques for creating quick maps for exploratory analysis.  It introduces some of the most-commonly used functions and packages for visualizing spatial data in R.  The notebook also compares different mapping approaches and considerations, giving you the tools to decide which approach is most appropriate for your data and work.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook also serves as the foundation for chapter 6, which covers mapping and spatial data visualization more broadly.  Later notebooks in this chapter dive deeper into working with point and polygon data, choropleth mapping, and advanced skills like interactive mapping and design choices for creating polished, finalized maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chapter 6.01 will introduce foundational mapping concepts and get you started with mapping in R\n",
    "- Chapter 6.02 will expand on point and polygon mapping using more complex datasets\n",
    "- Chapter 6.03 will explore choropleth mapping and data classification\n",
    "- Chapters 6.04 through 6.06 will provide tools for adding basemaps to your maps\n",
    "- Chapters 6.07 and 6.08 will guiide you in the development of dynamic, interactive maps and dashboards\n",
    "- Chapters 6.09 and 6.10 will help you polish and finalize your map for professional publications and presentations"

    "\n",
    "This notebook covers multiple ways to make maps in R:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base R `plot()`** - A fast and simple way to plot spatial data, perfect for quick data checks and the beginning stages of exploratory analysis\n",
    "2. **`ggplot2` with `geom_sf()`** - A comprehensive method for producing a wide range of high-quality, beautiful maps and other visualizations\n",
    "3. **`tmap`** - An intuitive syntax specifically designed for maps with interactive mapping capabilities\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A great first step in using [*ggplot2*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) for spatial visualization is to plot only the geometries in your spatial object without any attributes or variables. This allows you to quickly assess the shapes, locations, and layout of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of any ggplot2 map is the combination of [*ggplot*](https://rdrr.io/cran/ggplot2/man/ggplot.html) and [*geom_sf*](https://rdrr.io/cran/ggplot2/man/ggsf.html) which is used to render spatial objects stored in the [simple features (sf)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) structure.  This creates a simple map showing just the geometries.  When no fill or color aesthetic is specified, [*ggplot2*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) will use default values to outline polygons or plot points."

    "Using [*ggplot2*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html), we can map variables by assigning them to aesthetics like fill, color, or size. For example, we might shade polygons based on population density, or color points based on category or count.\n",

    "In this section, you’ll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the aes() function within geom_sf() to link spatial data attributes to visual elements.\n",
    "- Control how data-driven attributes are mapped to the appearance of the plot.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Specifically designed for thematic mapping\n",
    "- Intuitive, map-focused syntax\n",
    "- Easy switching between static and interactive\n",
    "- Built-in cartographic elements (scale bars, north arrows)\n",
    "- Professional default styling\n",
    "- Excellent for creating map layouts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Less flexible than ggplot2 for non-map visualizations\n",
    "- Smaller ecosystem than ggplot2\n",
    "- Less integration with non-spatial tidyverse workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best use cases:**\n",
    "- Thematic mapping is your primary focus\n",
    "- Need both static and interactive versions\n",
    "- Want cartographic best practices by default\n",
    "- Creating map layouts and arrangements\n",

    "## 6.  Comparing Mapping Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to create maps in R, each with its own strengths depending on your goals, workflow, and audience.  We've now explored three different ways to create maps in R. Let's compare them side by side:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `plot()` is fast and simple - great for quick data checks and exploratory work.\n",
    "- `ggplot2` is highly customizable and integrates well with tidyverse data pipelines.\n",
    "- `tmap` provides easy thematic mapping with high-level functions and supports both static and interactive mapping modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | base R plot() | ggplot2 | tmap |\n",
    "|---------|--------------|---------|------|\n",
    "| **Learning Curve** | Easy | Moderate | Moderate |\n",
    "| **Code Verbosity** | Minimal | Moderate | Minimal |\n",
    "| **Customization** | Limited | Extensive | Moderate-Extensive |\n",
    "| **Map Elements** | Basic | Via extensions | Built-in |\n",
    "| **Interactivity** | No | Via plotly | Built-in |\n",
    "| **Faceting** | Manual | Excellent | Good |\n",
    "| **Publication Quality** | Basic | Excellent | Excellent |\n",
    "| **Speed** | Very Fast | Moderate | Moderate |\n",
    "| **Tidyverse Integration** | No | Yes | Partial |\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Each Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use base R `plot()` when:\n",
    "- Doing quick exploratory analysis\n",
    "- Checking if data loaded correctly\n",
    "- Working interactively in the console\n",
    "- Speed is more important than aesthetics\n",
    "- You need a quick visual check, not a final product\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use ggplot2 when:\n",
    "- Creating publication-quality figures\n",
    "- Integrating with other ggplot2 visualizations\n",
    "- Need extensive customization options\n",
    "- Working within tidyverse workflows\n",
    "- Creating faceted (small multiple) maps\n",
    "- Want consistency across all your visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use tmap when:\n",
    "- Thematic mapping is your primary goal\n",
    "- Need both static and interactive versions\n",
    "- Want cartographic elements (scale bars, north arrows) easily\n",
    "- Prefer concise, map-specific syntax\n",
    "- Creating map layouts and arrangements\n",
    "- Rapid prototyping of map designs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Workflow Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, many R users combine all three approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with `plot()`** for initial data exploration\n",
    "2. **Use `tmap`** for creating and iterating on thematic maps\n",
    "3. **Switch to `ggplot2`** when you need to integrate maps with other visualizations or need very specific customization\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no single \"best\" approach—the right tool depends on your specific needs and context."
